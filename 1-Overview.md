# Overview

FastCore is here to provide greater freedom to improve the shopping experience. We use Composable commerce (CC) in our system, which is an approach to commerce that allows retailers to combine multiple systems to meet consumer demands across multiple channels with greater agility, convenience, and flexibility.

This new version of the framework will impact your customer and your developers by establishing a quality approach. The framework will allow your users to choose which framework best fits their needs and knowledge to build a storefront. This will allow them to take advantage of two different communities, ours and the web framework, improving their implementation speed and the number of pluggable features they will have at their disposal.

## Key points
- Create the unique experiences you need at any touch point.
- Create the commerce experiences that require complex requirements.
- Combine your in-house solutions with third-party apps and services.
- Combine the data, content, and services you need.
- Respond quickly to business changes.
