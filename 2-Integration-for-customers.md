# Integration for customers

Considering the improvements that FastStore can provide to its customers, it is interesting to provide a guide with technical documentation to support the integration of developers with the platform, so that customers will have a more pleasant experience. 

It is necessary to conduct a survey and get feedback from customers about the change to the new platform. It is ideal to show a comparison of the old Legacy CMS Portal solution with what FastStore can deliver.
